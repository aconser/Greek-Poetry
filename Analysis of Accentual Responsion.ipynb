    "These scripts use the accentual analysis tools in my Greek-Poetry repository to illustrate my findings on the responsion of accentual contours between paired stanzas (strophe and antistrophe) in the songs of Greek tragedy.  The code I have written breaks each stanza up into syllables (taking resolutions into account), and aligns the syllables between the two stanzas according to the meter.  For each syllable, it is determined whether the accentual contours of the containing word/phrase demand that the melody rise, fall or repeat the current note.  This is done using the principles of melody-accent alignment which are exhibited in many ancient musical documents, and especially in the Delphic Hymns.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "By comparing the 'melodic' contours of the two paired stanzas, it can be determined how well the melodies align.  If the composers respected the accents in their melodies, then contradictions could only be resolved by repeating notes.  In this case, the number of contradictions indicates the repetitiveness of the original melody."
