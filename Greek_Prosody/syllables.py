    or two syllables (incompatible vowels, or marked by breathing/diaeresis).
    There is unfortunately some ambiguity in using the OCT texts, since they are
    not consistent in differentiating adscripts and diaereses, e.g. Δηιάνειρα 
    is not an adscript, while ἆιστος can be either, depending on accentuation
    and meter. 
    
    In the case of apparent adscripts with missing diaereses, I will have to 
    add these to the text manually (e.g. Δηϊάνειρα). If, however, the iota has
    an accent, this distinguishes it as two syllables.
    
    In the case of alpha + iota, the program defaults to separate syllables,
    with the exception of alphas which are accented with a circumflex, e.g. 
    ἆιϲτοϲ.  In a basic search of Aeschylus and Sophocles, these were all
    subscripts. Other subscripts may have to be joined as resolutions.
