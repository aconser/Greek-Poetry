A set of tools for analyzing sound patterns in Greek Poetry
created by Prof. Anna Conser (University of Cincinnati)

FYI: This is a work in development.  The code has been designed to function on my personal
computer, and may require substantial adjustment to be used by others.

These tools support the analysis of sound patterns in Greek poetry.  This includes tools
for analyzing rhythmic durations in both prose and poetry (see the Greek_Prosody module), 
as well as more specialized tools for reconstructing pitch contours based on lexical accents.

Additionally, the Analysis module supports the alignment of stanzas by syllable, such
that one may compare the accentual melodies of lyric stanzas that would have originally 
shared a sung melody.  This can be displayed in the form of 'scansion', or studied 
statistically at various levels, from stanza to play to author.

The Analysis module is designed to draw texts from a folder containing .csv files for each 
tragic author ('Corpus').  I have not uploaded this out of concern for copyright, but I 
am willing to investigate the sharing of data if contacted privately.
